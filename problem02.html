				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ask her the reason why she is apprehensive. There could be a variety of reasons, such as concerns with confidentiality, a sense of learned helplessness, being intimidated or having a fear of being judged or treated differently (wanting to be treated the same as everyone else), or cultural stigma.</li>
					<li>As a mentor, we can assure her that Georgian College overall has a strong culture of tolerance and acceptance, that it is a safe space, that the faculty and services will accommodate for accessibility, and that the faculty wants what is in studentsâ€™ best interests so that they complete their programs successfully. </li>
					<li>Self-advocacy can be encouraged by helping to give her a sense of confidence. Remind her that she is competent and capable of vocalizing her rights, and that her disability is not a reflection of her competence or potential. </li>
					<li>Let the student know that the help is there, but only she can ask for it and speak for her rights to accessibility. Also remind her that the steps she takes in order to reach her goals are important, and only she is in control of her care and her life. </li>
					<li>Remind her that she will not be judged negatively for asking for the help she needs to help reach her goals. She can develop self-advocacy skills by practicing assertiveness and asking for help when needed. </li>
					<li>As a mentor, we can help by offering to assist her in writing an email that she needs to send to her faculty in realtion to the accessibility letter, or simply let her know that the services are always available when needed. </li>
