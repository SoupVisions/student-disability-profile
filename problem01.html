				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a mentor, ask her why she feels she is in the wrong program. She may have logical, pragmatic  reasons, such as that she feels her personality and learning style may not be compatible with the program, or she may feel discouraged by performance that is not to her personal standards, or perhaps her social life may be affecting her attittude (she may not have many friends in the same program). 
</li>
					<li>Assess whether she has long term goals and what her alternative interests may be.</li>
					<li>Offer an alternative perspective and some encouragement. That in every program, the journey of completing the program may have highs and lows, and moments of uncertainty and perhaps doubt, and that is OK and probably common to other students. Not all of the program may be enjoyable or be what was expected. Some classes may be very challenging and/or discouraging to a student. 
</li>
					<li>Refer her to a counsellor at B110 where they have tools to assess career paths, personality tests and offer program and career counselling. 
</li>
