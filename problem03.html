				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a mentor, acknowledge her feelings, but gently remind her that not all classes will be enjoyable. Some classes will be more interesting, and some will be less, but the student needs to attend to be successful. And remind the student of the bigger picture that getting the boring classes out of the way will bring her closer to her goal of completing her program.</li>
					<li>Suggest ways to make the material more interesting, such as relating content to the studentâ€™s own life or examples, or learning the material in ways that are compatible with the student's best learning style (visual, kinesthetic, auditory, etc.). </li>
					<li>Suggest buddying up with another student to study together. Discussing with another student can make it more interesting and learnable. </li>
