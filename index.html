			<p>Xushan moved to Canada (to Barrie specifically) with her family when she was sixteen years old. She generally has learning difficulties with reading comprehension, which is compounded by a language barrier. Xushan has always been interested in visual arts, and is taking Laurentian's Art History program (through Georgian) to develop a sound historical and theoretical foundation for what she hopes will be her field (Graphic Design), and to learn English better.</p>
